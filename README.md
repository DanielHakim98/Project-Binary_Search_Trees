# Project: Binary Search Trees
* According to wikipedia, Binary search trees is a rooted binary tree data structure.
* It consist of parent nodes and child nodes connected from top to bottom, forming a branch extended from root node (the most top node).
* If the child node data is greater than parent node, then it will be placed on the right parent's sub-tree.
* If the child node data is less than parent node, then it wil be placed on the left of the parent's sub-tree.
